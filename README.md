# Wall Editor

## Project Description
Wall Editor is a sophisticated 3D wall design application built with Three.js that enables users to create and visualize wall layouts in both 2D and 3D views. The application features an interactive canvas where users can draw, modify, and visualize walls with real-time 3D rendering.

## Key Features
- Interactive 2D and 3D wall design
- Real-time 3D visualization using Three.js
- Grid-based wall placement with snapping
- Zoom and pan controls
- Wall texture mapping
- Responsive design
- Orbit controls for 3D view
- Wall deletion and modification
- Grid system for precise measurements

## Technologies Used
- Three.js for 3D rendering
- TypeScript for type-safe development
- Vite for fast development and building
- HTML5 Canvas for 2D rendering
- CSS3 for styling
- Node.js for development environment

## Technical Highlights
- Custom 3D scene management
- Raycasting for interactive wall selection
- Orthographic and perspective camera systems
- Custom shader materials for wall textures
- Event-driven architecture
- Responsive canvas resizing
- Grid-based coordinate system

## Objective
The project aims to provide architects and designers with a powerful yet intuitive tool for creating and visualizing wall layouts in both 2D and 3D spaces, leveraging the capabilities of Three.js for high-quality 3D rendering and interaction.
